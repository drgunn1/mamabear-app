## Application

This application acquires sensors values and display them in a simple interface. The sensors value acquisition is done through the listening of the corresponding sensors topics from a MQTT broker.

### Requirements

* Qt 6.2.X or newer.
* QtMqtt package, which build and installation is described [bellow](#qt-dependency-build)

Note: The application was developed and tested with **Qt 6.5.2** but it should work with Qt version **6.2.X and newer**.

### Build

1. Set environment
    ```
    export QT_VERSION="<qt-version>"

    export QT_INSTALL_DIR="<path-to-qt>/Qt/"
    export CMAKE_BIN_DIR="${QT_INSTALL_DIR}/Tools/CMake/bin"
    export QMAKE_BIN_DIR="${QT_INSTALL_DIR}/${QT_VERSION}/gcc_64/bin"
    export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="${QT_INSTALL_DIR}/${QT_VERSION}/gcc_64"
    export NINJA_DIR="${QT_INSTALL_DIR}/Tools/Ninja"
    export PATH="${PATH}:${CMAKE_BIN_DIR}:${QMAKE_BIN_DIR}:${NINJA_DIR}"
   ```

2. build
    ```
    mkdir <mamabear-app>/build
    cd <mamabear-app>/build
    ${QMAKE_BIN_DIR}/qt-configure-module ..
    ${CMAKE_BIN_DIR}/cmake --build .
    ```

## MQTT

### Qt dependency build

Mqtt module despite being available is not distributed/installed by default along with Qt.
To be able to build mamabearApp one must first build and install QMqtt following the instructions bellow.

1. Set environment
    ```
    export QT_VERSION="<qt-version>"

    export QT_INSTALL_DIR="<path-to-qt>/Qt/"
    export CMAKE_BIN_DIR="${QT_INSTALL_DIR}/Tools/CMake/bin"
    export QMAKE_BIN_DIR="${QT_INSTALL_DIR}/${QT_VERSION}/gcc_64/bin"
    export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="${QT_INSTALL_DIR}/${QT_VERSION}/gcc_64"
    export NINJA_DIR="${QT_INSTALL_DIR}/Tools/Ninja"
    export PATH="${PATH}:${CMAKE_BIN_DIR}:${QMAKE_BIN_DIR}:${NINJA_DIR}"
   ```

2. Download source

    Choose the branch that corresponds to the qt version with which you want to build this application.

    ```
    cd <mqtt-dir>
    git clone -b <qt-version> git://code.qt.io/qt/qtmqtt.git
    ```

3. Build and Install
    ```
    mkdir <mqtt-dir>/qtmqtt/build
    cd <mqtt-dir>/qtmqtt/build
    ${QMAKE_BIN_DIR}/qt-configure-module ..
    ${CMAKE_BIN_DIR}/cmake --build .
    ${CMAKE_BIN_DIR}/cmake --install . --verbose
    ```

### In app

The application has a single subscription to all topics through the `#` id but filters out what it
receives from the sensors it is interest in. The list of topics considered are listed:

+ sensors/sht40-temperature
+ sensors/sht40-humidity
+ sensors/sgp40-voc
+ sensors/bmi323-accelerometerX
+ sensors/bmi323-accelerometerY
+ sensors/bmi323-accelerometerZ
+ sensors/bmi323-gyroscopeX
+ sensors/bmi323-gyroscopeY
+ sensors/bmi323-gyroscopeZ
+ sensors/mlx90632-temperature
+ sensors/microphone
+ sensors/sr040-distance
